# low_tracks
An R tool to plot tracks of meteorological cyclones. This tool grabs data from the GFS or HRRR models,
and finds the track of a low pressure system within a given date range and starting location. This tool
can also plot the paths using ggplot. The tool requires pacman to load packages.
